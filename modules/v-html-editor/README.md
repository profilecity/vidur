## v-html-editor

This is a wrapper over Codemirror to provide a fully featured code editor, comprehensive previews, polyfilling styles (potenitally from CSS abstractions such as tailwind, unocss, etc.).

This also supports using templating using variables, providing ability to inject / extract variable names to generate / build correct html representation of desired content.

While variables are injected, it is possible to visualise HTML using either dummy values or fancy placeholder styles.
