## Development Setup
```sh
# Requirements: A PostgreSQL instance up-and-running.
# Clone the repo and cd into the folder.
npm i -g yarn         # install yarn package manager, if you don't have already.
yarn                  # install all the dependencies
cp .env.example .env  # Create env file and fill the fields. (DO NOT CHANGE PORT)
yarn migration:apply  # Create database schema.
yarn dev              # Finally, start the dev server.
```

**Or simply use Docker**
```bash
docker compose --profile dev up 
```

This command starts the `db` and `app` services using the `dev` profile. It runs PostgreSQL as `database` and the app as `vidur_app`.
